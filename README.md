Two algorithms named EMSFUI-D and EMSFUI-B are proposed to mine skyline frequent-utility itemsets. EMSFUI-D performs the depth-first search to explore the search space of all itemsets. EMSFUI-B discovers itemsets based on the breadth-first search. Both algorithms utilize two pruning strategies to limit the search space.
